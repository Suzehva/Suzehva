Hi there! 👋 My name is Suze (pronounced: Suzie) and I’m studying Computer Science at Stanford University. 

I get excited about computer systems and machine learning – I recently built a [FAT32 file system navigator for the Rasberry Pi](https://github.com/aditi-bhaskar/suziti-filesystem) and do interpretability research on the concept [time in language models](https://github.com/Suzehva/time-in-language-models). 

For more on these projects, see [my website](https://cs.stanford.edu/~suzeva/).
