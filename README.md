# Hey 👋 I'm Suze!
🌲 I'm an undergraduate/coterm studying Computer Science (Systems/AI) at Stanford University.

✨ I get excited about natural language processing and machine learning – I lead
research on how [language models (fail to) conceptualize time](https://github.com/Suzehva/time-in-language-models),
am working on emergent capabilities and eval scaling, and recently built a
[FAT32 file system navigator for the Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/aditi-bhaskar/suziti-filesystem).

🔎 For more on these projects, see [my website](https://cs.stanford.edu/~suzeva/).
